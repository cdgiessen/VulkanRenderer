# VulkanRenderer

C++17 Game Engine built ontop of the Vulkan Graphics API

Used as a testing ground for learning various software techniques and solutions for engineering problems. 

Undergone heavy revision since July 2017 and is still under construction.

## Major Features
 * Terrain Renderer, Heightmap based with automatic level of detail adjustment using a Quadtree  and memory pool for quick allocation. 
 * Procedural Noise Texture Generator, Visual node graph replacement for libNoise that takes advantage of SIMD hardware using the FastNoiseSIMD library. Meant to be an easy to use tool for creating custom procedural terrain. Implements saving and loading with a json schema. Uses Dear ImGUI for its GUI
 * Windows and Linux Support, Cross platform. Built and tested on both major OSâ€™s.
 * Multitasking System, (WIP) Thread pool based tasking system that enables task based multithreading of various jobs. 
 * Frame Graph, (WIP) Takes all rendering operations and resources and abstracts into a single graph, enabling simpler code and reasoning about how a frame is rendered.

## Build Process
Requirements: C++17 Compiler, CMake 3.7, Vulkan 1.1 SDK, GLFW, GLM, Vcpgk (windows), GTK (linux)

Windows:
Install Vulkan SDK, and vcpgk.
Use vcpkg to install GLFW and GLM. 
Open the folder containing using Visual Studio's "Open Cmake Folder" functionality. 

Linux:
Install Vulkan SDK, GLFW, GLM, and GTK
Configure the project like any normal CMake project.

## Plans
I plan to include the aforementioned Multitasking system and Frame Graph as well as the following:
 * Depth Prepass
 * Forward+ lighting
 * Shader creator - allowing easy shader creation
 * glTF model loading
 * Terrain scatter/futher terrain details
 * Procedural Sky Shader
 * Integrate Bullet Physics
